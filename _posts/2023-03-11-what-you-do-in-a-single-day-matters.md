title: What you do on a single day matters.
---

**TL;DR** Another Insights, that is kind of how one should live life.

It is easy to underestimate the weight of small actions like practicing one hour today or not practicing today.

I personally believe that life is built on those little decisions, every single one of them counts, everything you do is going to matter in your future along with everything you didn't do.

So if you really want something, you must be willing to make those small decisions when they seem trivial.

"If I miss the gym today it shouldn't make much difference to if I go today"

"If I don't practice much today in the long run it won't make much difference to if I do"

"If I don't talk to him/her today I will get another chance another day"

"I have a problem with a certain person, I will try to solve it later"

All these sentences may sound right in the short term, but in the long run you will look back and realize that all those little decisions are what got you to where you are, so try not to downplay them.

A big part of this is also about the thought process, the more you allow yourself to choose the “not doing” over the ‘doing’ the easier it will be to keep “not doing”, so for those things that matter to you try to make the go to always be the “doing”.

And believe me that if you adopt this idea and make “doing” your go to, this will be reflected in the results (the best way to get better at solving problems is to solve problems), the more problems you do the easier it will be to associate a new problem to one you have already seen before and in this way it will be easier and easier to do more difficult problems. I also hope you can apply this advice to your whole life (mainly in the things you care about and love the most), college, school, gym, competitive programming, friends, family, love relationships, parenting, etc....

It cost me a lot to learn this and I lost very valuable things for me in the process so I hope this blog will be useful for someone.
