This post aims to thoroughly describe my personal approach to problem solving. 

Often, when people who are good at math solve a problem, they might say something like, “This problem required a lot of insight.” However, the term "insightful" is quite vague. What makes a problem insightful?

Let's continue the conversation with a simple example. Suppose we have the inequality 
|x — 5| > 3
How would you solve this problem?

Most people will think of one of two methods:

1. Graphical Method: Plot
x — 5
, then reflect it across the x-axis to graph
 |x — 5|
, draw the horizontal line
y = 3
, and visually determine the solution range.  


3. Piecewise Method: Break down
|x — 5|
 into a conditional function
(
x — 5
 when
x — 5 ≥ 0
, and
5 — x
 when
x — 5 < 0
)
, solve the inequality for each range separately, and combine the results.


Great. How did you come up with your solution? If you have studied math sufficiently, most of you would have come up with a solution effortlessly. Why is that?

People who are good at solving math problems often intuitively know how to approach a problem as soon as they see it. This is because their extensive problem-solving experience and knowledge have been subconsciously internalized. Especially when dealing with concepts that require insight, such as absolute value functions, this intuition becomes more pronounced.

The absolute value function itself cannot do much on its own. For example, solving an inequality like 
x² > 3
is straightforward by taking the square root of both sides, but solving 
|x — 5| > 3
is not as simple. This is because the absolute value function is defined conditionally based on the value of x. It returns 
'5 — x'
when x is less than 5 and 
'x — 5'
when x is greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, to solve an absolute value inequality, you need to consider it conditionally. This idea is called 'insight,' and while it must be consciously thought of at first, with much practice, it becomes internalized and can be applied subconsciously. This is what we call 'intuition.'

When you have well-established insights like this, seeing an absolute value expression immediately triggers the thought, “Ah, this is how I should solve it.” This is referred to as intuition. People who are good at problem solving have well-established intuition. Problems can indeed be very large, but locally established intuitions, like the one for absolute values, serve as excellent tools for problem solving. As these intuitions accumulate, they make approaching problems easier. It is no exaggeration to say that this determines the ability to generate insights.


*Developing Insight* (08-21-16) 
So, how can we develop the ability to generate insights?  In solving math problems, the concept of 'assigning inevitability' is often emphasized. This means consciously organizing parts of the problem-solving process that you might not have initially thought of and understanding why you need to solve it that way. 

For example, when solving the absolute value inequality 
|x — 5| > 3
, we divide the problem into cases where x is greater than or equal to 5 and where x is less than 5. Here, 'assigning inevitability' involves questioning and organizing why we need to divide and solve the problem in this manner.

In other words, you need to realize, "Because the absolute value function is expressed differently depending on the value of x, we need to solve the problem by dividing it into cases." Through this process of assigning inevitability, you can recall and apply the relevant concepts when encountering similar problems.

This assigning inevitability goes beyond simply finding the correct answer; it helps deepen your understanding of the problem-solving process. This enhances your problem-solving abilities and develops the cognitive skills necessary to apply them to new types of problems.

Therefore, to achieve good results in math and, more broadly, in the entire PS domain, actively utilizing 'assigning inevitability' is essential. While solving problems, you need to review your solution process and make an effort to understand why you solved it that way. Through this, you can internalize the concepts and ideas necessary for problem solving.

Upsolving is similarly important for similar reasons. It is the process of enhancing your abilities by solving problems that you previously couldn’t solve, ultimately enabling you to tackle them successfully.

Kudos! ;)
