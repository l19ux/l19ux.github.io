title: Feasibility Bias

**TL;DR** 

*Disclaimer*: 

# What is Bias?
Devaluing your current achievements and instead attaching yourself to new ones. You're biased against what you've already accomplished and biased towards what you haven't yet accomplished, another way to think about it is that, you are biased against the things that are feasible for you to acheive. If you've already accomplished the goal, the sitaution is similar. It would be easy for you to hit the goal again, so you focus on the aspect, instead of the work it took to make the goal easy.

# So How does it works?
bad view: All your years of grinding seem completely worthless.
good view: you keep pushing forward
so it's hard to tell, if it's bad or good.

When you get close certain goal you feel entitled to it, because you're close to it, you've worked for it, and it becomes normalized and normal is bad , so with the value of your previous goal abolished, the only thing to turn to is the next goal. Also is the metric a perpetually moving goalpost, that is the reason why I can never be happy with accomplishments, because whenever I get close, the goal I previously set becomes "NORMAL" (i.e not noteworthy), the next goal becomes the important one before I even finish the previous goal, so by the time I get it, it means nothing.

# The Hack
The longer a goal is in your head, the more used to it you become, too (even without being close)


# Conclusion
This was more of an awareness thing and nothing else, sometimes it's hard to recognise these cognitives biases that influence your thinking, but recognising it is the hardest step, doing something that is also hard that is the introspection it takes to recognising this is tricky, especially if you don't know what you are looking for, but now you do, so lucky you ;) But moderating it will be tough, constantly trying to reshape your own thoughts can be a long and tedious process, but for the sake of your own happiness and success it can be worth it.
