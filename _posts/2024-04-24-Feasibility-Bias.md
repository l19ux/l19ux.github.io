Hard Problems
Mixture 'A' contains Alcohol and water in the ratio 7:8 respectively and mixture 'B' contains Alcohol and water in the ratio 5:4, respectively. If 'P' litres of mixture 'A' and 'Q' litres of mixture 'B' was taken out in an empty container 'X' and then R% of that mixture from container 'X' was taken out and was replaced with same quantity of juice, then the ratio of Alcohol, water and Juice in the container becomes 2:2:1, respectively. Roots of the equation, x^2 - 90x - N = 0 are (2P) and -(Q+15) respectively. Where P > Q. Find the quadratic equation whose roots are 'Q' and 'R'.  A = (d)
(a) X^2 + 25x + 900 = 0  (b) X^2 + 65x + 900 = 0 (c) X^2 - 25x + 900 = 0 (d) X^2 - 65x + 900 = 0

In three containers A, B and C, A contains mixture of HCL and NaCl in ratio 5:3 while B contains ‘x’ liter of pure NaCl where ‘x’ is the root of (x^2 - 14x - 51 = 0) and vessel C contains ‘y’ liter pure HCL where ‘y’ is the smaller root of (y^2 - 25x + 156 = 0). Half content of A is poured into B, and then content of B is poured into C. If content of C is poured again into A, then find initial quantity of mixture in A if final ratio of HCL and NaCl in vessel A is 8:5. A = 608
Item K is produced by mixing chemical A and chemical B in the ratio of 7:5. Chemical A is prepared by mixing two raw materials, X and Y, in the ratio of 2: 5. Chemical B is prepared by mixing raw materials, Y and Z, in the ratio of 3: 2. Then the final mixture is prepared by mixing 756 units of Item K with water. If the concentration of the raw material Y in the final mixture is 45%, how much water had been added to Item K? A = 364 



Some Variable & Equation Based Problems
