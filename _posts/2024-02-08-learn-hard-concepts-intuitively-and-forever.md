title: Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)
---



 let's start with what it means to understand some concept intuitively basically it means that you're able to accept that concept as a fundamental truth without needing to justify it so basically your brain is hardwired to process that concept as a fact it's like second nature for example let me test your intuitive understanding of addition try adding two plus two bam didn't even have to think about it right the answer is obviously five so your intuition probably carried you there the answer was so obvious that you didn't even have to question it it's just embedded in your thinking, you don't have to second guess yourself your brain understands it completely and is capable of reasoning with it, but if something is unintuitive that means your brain disagrees with it or goes against what you've learned previously and you need to fix that so what if you don't have that hard wiring then you need to rewire your brain to accept the concept as an absolute truth and that's the *learning process*

and it's worth noting that there's no actual magic here ultimately it's up to your brain to do this rewiring the best you can do is set your brain up for success by optimizing the information it receives and works with,  so let's get into how you do that so first : 
	1. first you want to generate as many insights as possible and insights are random thoughts to help you understand it more like knowledge of the purpose of a particular step or a particular example that helps illustrate the concept and mostly you only gain into aside from experience so this method will give you a lot of experience with the concept in different ways ultimately you want to put your brain to work generating insights like an inside machine
	2.  treat learning like problem solving and I'll get more into this later but your brain has an insane problem solving capacity both in thinking and remembering
	3. understand small pieces at a time because if you try and take on too much at once you'll overwhelm yourself so break the concept down into small pieces if possible and then tackle those pieces one by one
	4. forget memorization and I feel like this is important to mention this method is not memorization far from it this is rewiring your brain to accept this concept as an absolute truth memorization is short term but this is forever so if you're used to just memorizing get ready for a whole new level of understanding now
	
let's start with the actual method and I'm going to use the method to explain the method, start with everything abstracted out meaning you know what purpose it serves but not necessarily the details or how it works and just understand the big picture as little information as possible to understand what the concept's, as you learn and understand more expand on the details of certain things to learn a specific detail, there are three steps: (1) understand the detail in context  (2) understand it by itself (3) reinforce it.

<hr>
(1) understand the detail in context :  so the first step is understanding the detail in context as you expand on detail make sure you understand at every step how the pieces fit together, you should really understand the problem because if you smear the problem into your head then the solution will be much more natural so you ultimately want a deep insightful understanding of the problem and how do you do that I propose that you should try and solve the problem for yourself try to invent the piece before you even try to understand how it works,  if it's less like a problem more like a general rule of something you can't really solve it you can still do stuff like looking at examples and trying to reverse engineer the rule in general there's usually something you can do to try and invent the piece from scratch and you should try and the point of doing all this is just to let your brain explore the possible Avenues and deeply internalize the problem because whenever you've been stuck on a hard problem you've likely remembered it for a hard time because you convince your brain that it's important and you should give yourself time working out with both your conscious and unconscious brain the unconscious brain plays a huge part in developing intuition so you have to give it some exercise too and the way to do that is just to care about the problem enough to have it be the main focus of your brain,  you know how you can get in a heated argument and like 10 hours later you come by the perfect comeback when it's way too late to even be remotely useful that's your unconscious brain it was silently going to work processing the argument and crafting response without even you thinking about it and it did that because you cared about that argument so you have to do the same thing for this concept force your brain to care and it'll put in the work for you and trying to solve the problem and putting in the effort is how you convince your brain to care and once you've tried for a while and you're completely tired of the problem and you don't think you'll get any possible benefit from trying anymore then you can look at the solution or the the overall piece but of course don't just look at the solution you should learn in the same way but break it into pieces and slowly absorb each of those pieces you may also consider having someone give you hints because that can further help the problem solving process especially for those very hard Concepts require a new way of thinking hints may be the perfect way to guide you through it but either way because you put so much time into the problem you left a gap in your brain for that solution to fill since your brain spends so much time processing it and once you read the solution it'll naturally fit into the Gap and you'll be able to retain the knowledge for much longer since you essentially rewired your brain to be mentally capable of processing the problem and its solution whenever you spend a long time on a problem you convince your Primal brain that it's important to survival so you'll remember both the problem and the solution very well since your brain is convinced it's absolutely necessary and this should align with your experience too because if you spent a long time trying to figure something out you just remember it better
<hr>
(3) there's more you have to do to internalize the solution you have to reinforce it and confirm that it stays in your brain or you won't be able to remember for long and there's a process you can do to reinforce the whole concept but it also works with reinforcing each piece of it so you can do it for both so let's get into how you can do that there are roughly four steps and I'll explain each step using my method as well there's no strict order to these but I've picked what I think is the best order for myself at least the general idea is 
		3.1 you should try to invent the piece or concept 
		3.2 then once you're done with that, practice it 
		3.3 and afterwards understand it to the point of being able to explain it 
		3.4 after doing that you should explore ideas related to the concept and all of this is to try and look at the concept from a bunch of different angles and get as many insights as possible all about it.
