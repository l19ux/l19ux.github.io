title: Strat & Beating 1/4 Negative Marking.
---

# Strat
There are mainly 2 strategies that have a high success rate and are fairly popular, decide which suits u better :
    1. GA (5 mins) - English (9-11 mins) - Reasoning (17-18 mins) - Math (26-27 mins)
    2. English (9-11 mins) - GK (5 mins) - Reasoning (17-18 mins) - Math (26-27 mins)

# Tips 
1. Attempt every single question (+2, -0.5 and at least 1/4 probability of being correct : EXPLAINED HERE).
2. No marking for review/coming back to question - feed in all answers you know and use gut feeling (first thought) for ones you don't know about.
3. Don't change strategy mid way into the exam, at any cost.

# Why 100% attempt rate is better?

The 1/4 probability of correct is for 1 question.
Let's say success == getting correct answer
For 1 question, probably of success = 1/4
And probably of failure (i.e. not success) = 3/4
Probability for 'r' number of success in 100 questions is given by 100 Cr (1/4)r (3/4)100-r
So probability of doing 25 questions correctly (i.e. 25 success) = 100 C25 (1/4)25 (3/4)75 ≈ 0.091 = 9%
Probability of doing all 100 correctly ≈ 6.22 x 10^-61 = 6.22 x 10^-59%
Probability of doing all 100 wrong ≈ 3.207 x 10^-13 = 3.207 x 10^-11%

This is a nice way to look at it, but what we've calculated here is the probability of getting exactly 25 correct (not 24, not 26, exactly 25). So a more practical approach is to first nullify the guesswork (net zero delta), we need at least 20/100 correct. So going by our method, we'll have to add up probabilities of conditions in which one would get 20,21,22,23 . . . Correct (upto 100) and that would give us the desired probability (in favour of our net zero condition).

Another thing to note here is that, all this is for a 25% probability of correct answer. Whereas what actually happens in the exam is different. In the end, there would be questions in which 1/2 options would be easy to eliminate and that would increase their probability of being correct to 33/50%.

Lastly, there would be a few (~6-8 max) questions requiring blind guessing. All this binomial probability formula needs to be used up there. One is free to not use all this but based on my experiences and calculations, it works/has worked for me everytime. I just shared my strategy, one is free to decide for themselves and that's all for the mathematical calrification on what I meant by the net positive delta. :) cheers!
