#Do you really love competitive programming?

Be honest with yourself here. No need to do it if you don't love it. Though make sure not to give up while you're a novice, try to get some understanding of what competitive programming (CP) really is.

Rule of thumb: you love something truly if you enjoy even the parts that others find strange. Debugging, for example. 

#On Talent vs Determination

Too much is said on the topic, I don't want to dive deep here. I genuinely believe that we severely underestimate ourselves, and anyone (with enough time and effort) can achieve anything.

Even if you feel you don't perform well at CP, remember that the real IQ test is the ability to get what you want from life. Probably being better than others on codeforces is not your end goal. 

#How not to worry?

You have to worry. Worrying is simply caring about the result. If you are 100% sure in yourself, you'll start to slack off -- skipping upsolving, editorials, etc. Be 99% sure in yourself.

If you don't worry, you work as usual. And ordinary effort never leads to extraordinary results.

#Motivation vs Discipline

They are inseparable. Motivation comes from "motive". What's your motive for practicing CP? If it's genuine, discipline will follow.

In my case, I wanted to get to IOI so bad that I quit all social media, games, and youtube. Didn't come back :)


#How not to burn out?

I don't believe in burnout. You might burn out solving Millennium Prize problems without making progress for decades. You can't burn out doing CP for just 3-4 years and tracking your progress easily.

And even if you got tired, it may be because 1) you've found something more interesting, or 2) you didn't really like CP in the first place, or 3) you're not seeing the progress. If that's the case, maybe you should really try something new.

#What if I have no progress?

If you are working hard enough and there's no improvement, just wait -- often progress comes in leaps. The rating might stand still for a year, and then jump 100 points in one contest. 

#How much to practice?

Rule: In any field, you can't do great things if you're not thinking about it in the shower. 

I practiced only when I wanted to. In other words, always :) Walking back home -- thinking about a problem. Showering -- thinking about a problem. Half-asleep -- thinking about a problem.|

#How to set goals?

Rule of thumb: if you are not embarrassed to say your goal out loud to your friends, the goal is not ambitious enough.

Another rule of thumb: if you don't fail at least 50% of your goals, they are not ambitious enough.

Last rule of thumb: set goals such that if successful, will make the rest of your career look like a footnote. 

#Be weird

Even if you are in a great community, be weird. Most of what people around you believe and do is wrong.

#Know yourself. Self-analysis

Know your areas of genius and weak spots. Get better at the former and try to eliminate the latter. I keep a diary to help me analyze that.
